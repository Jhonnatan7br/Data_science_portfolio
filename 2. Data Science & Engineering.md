# Data Science & Engineering

Some hypotheses are based on the available data and test them. Here are a few possibilities:

Hypothesis 1: Houses with a pool are more expensive on average than houses without a pool.
Hypothesis 2: The newer the house, the higher the price.
Hypothesis 3: The number of rooms in a house is positively correlated with the price of the house.
Hypothesis 4: Houses classified as 'Luxury' have more floors on average than houses classified as 'Basic'.

Let's test these hypotheses using the data. We will use statistical tests where appropriate, and visualization techniques for a more intuitive understanding.
Please note that while these tests might indicate certain trends or relationships in the data, they do not establish causation.

# Hypothesis 1
Let's start with the first hypothesis. We will compare the average prices of houses with a pool and houses without a pool.

RESULT
(4978765.065318035, 5007943.245826709)

The average price of houses with a pool is approximately $4,978,765, while the average price of houses without a pool is approximately $5,007,943. Contrary to our first hypothesis, houses without a pool are slightly more expensive on average than houses with a pool, based on this dataset.

# Hypothesis 2
Next, let's test the second hypothesis: "The newer the house, the higher the price." For this, we'll use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the year a house was built ('made') and the price of the house. A scatter plot will allow us to see whether there's a general trend of increasing prices in more recent construction years.

The scatter plot does not show a clear trend of increasing prices in more recent construction years. In fact, the points are evenly distributed across all years. This suggests that the year a house was built does not have a strong influence on its price, at least in this dataset. Therefore, we cannot confirm our second hypothesis that newer houses are priced higher.
