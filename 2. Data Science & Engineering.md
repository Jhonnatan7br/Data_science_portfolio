# Data Science & Engineering

Some hypotheses are based on the available data and test them. Here are a few possibilities:

Hypothesis 1: Houses with a pool are more expensive on average than houses without a pool.
Hypothesis 2: The newer the house, the higher the price.
Hypothesis 3: The number of rooms in a house is positively correlated with the price of the house.
Hypothesis 4: Houses classified as 'Luxury' have more floors on average than houses classified as 'Basic'.

Let's test these hypotheses using the data. We will use statistical tests where appropriate, and visualization techniques for a more intuitive understanding.
Please note that while these tests might indicate certain trends or relationships in the data, they do not establish causation.

# Hypothesis 1
Let's start with the first hypothesis. We will compare the average prices of houses with a pool and houses without a pool.

RESULT
(4978765.065318035, 5007943.245826709)

The average price of houses with a pool is approximately $4,978,765, while the average price of houses without a pool is approximately $5,007,943. Contrary to our first hypothesis, houses without a pool are slightly more expensive on average than houses with a pool, based on this dataset.

# Hypothesis 2
Next, let's test the second hypothesis: "The newer the house, the higher the price." For this, we'll use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the year a house was built ('made') and the price of the house. A scatter plot will allow us to see whether there's a general trend of increasing prices in more recent construction years.

The scatter plot does not show a clear trend of increasing prices in more recent construction years. In fact, the points are evenly distributed across all years. This suggests that the year a house was built does not have a strong influence on its price, at least in this dataset. Therefore, we cannot confirm our second hypothesis that newer houses are priced higher.

# Hypothesis 3

Now, let's test the third hypothesis: "The number of rooms in a house is positively correlated with the price of the house." We'll use a scatter plot again to visualize this relationship, and we'll also calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. A value close to 1 indicates a strong positive relationship.

The scatter plot does not show a clear trend of increasing price with a larger number of rooms. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of rooms and the price is approximately 0.01, which indicates a very weak positive correlation. Therefore, our third hypothesis that the number of rooms in a house is positively correlated with the price of the house is not supported by this dataset.

# Hypothesis 4

Finally, let's test the fourth hypothesis: "Houses classified as 'Luxury' have more floors on average than houses classified as 'Basic'." We will compare the average number of floors in 'Luxury' houses and 'Basic' houses to test this hypothesis.

<img width="569" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Jhonnatan7br/Hard-Luxury-Paris-Housing/assets/104907786/de66ae8c-4345-4f50-8c6d-6545d0bec818">

RESULT
(50.68695652173913, 50.137215528781795)

The average number of floors in 'Luxury' houses is approximately 50.69, while the average number of floors in 'Basic' houses is approximately 50.14. This suggests that 'Luxury' houses have slightly more floors on average than 'Basic' houses. Therefore, our fourth hypothesis is supported by this dataset.

# Hypothesis conclusions

In conclusion, out of the four hypotheses have been tested:

Houses with a pool are not more expensive on average than houses without a pool.
There is no clear trend of newer houses being more expensive.
The number of rooms in a house is not strongly correlated with the price of the house.
'Luxury' houses do have slightly more floors on average than 'Basic' houses.
These findings demonstrate the importance of examining our data and not making assumptions without evidence. It's also important to remember that these findings are specific to this dataset and may not apply to other datasets or to the housing market in Paris as a whole.

# Data engineering process (After cleaning and transformation)

- Time-Series Analysis:

Since the provided dataset doesn't seem to have a timestamp column, I'll use the made column as a makeshift time series. This will be for demonstration purposes only, and in a real-world scenario, you'd want actual timestamped data.
Detect seasonality or trends.
Implement window-based features.

- Database Storage:

We'll use SQLite for this demonstration due to its lightweight nature and compatibility within this environment. In a real-world scenario, you might consider more robust databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or distributed systems like Hadoop or Spark.
Create a table in SQLite and insert the data.

- Automation:

I'll provide a general framework or pseudo-code for an automated data pipeline, as implementing a full-fledged pipeline requires external tools and a running environment.
