# AI and Machine Learning

The steps involved will be:

- Data Preprocessing (Made on 1. Data cleaning, mining and transformation):

Handle missing values (if any).
Convert categorical variables to numerical format.
Normalize or standardize numerical features.
Split the data into training and test sets.
Model Building:

- Define the model architecture.
Compile the model.
Train the model.
Model Evaluation:

- Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
Plot the training history to observe how the model's loss and accuracy evolved.

1. Installing TensorFlow:
If you haven't installed TensorFlow on your local machine or target environment, you can do so using pip:

pip install tensorflow

2. Building the TensorFlow Model:
Here's the code to build a simple feed-forward neural network using TensorFlow for our regression task:

3. Evaluating the Model:
After training the model, you can plot the training and validation loss to observe how well the model learned:

4. Making Predictions:
Once you're satisfied with your model's performance, you can use it to make predictions:

predictions = model.predict(X_test_processed)

5. Model Saving and Loading:
If you want to save the trained model for later use:

model.save('house_price_model.h5')

And to load the model:

loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('house_price_model.h5')

Remember, neural networks often require a lot of tuning (like adjusting the number of layers, neurons, learning rate, etc.) to perform well on specific tasks. The model architecture provided is a starting point, and you might need to adjust it based on your results and the specific nuances of your data, or inclusively you can also create an automated pipeline to optimize this process.
