# Data analysis
A real estate brand would be interested in insights that can help them understand the market better, make informed decisions, and potentially optimize their pricing strategies. Here are some analyses and visualizations we can perform:

- Distribution of House Prices: This will provide an overview of the range and distribution of house prices in the dataset.
- Distribution of House Categories ('Basic' vs 'Luxury'): Understanding the proportion of houses in each category can give insights into market segmentation.
- Price Distribution by Category: Comparing the price distributions of 'Basic' and 'Luxury' houses.
- Price vs. Square Meters: Understand how the size of a property affects its price.
- Number of Houses with Specific Features: Such as having a pool, yard, or storm protector. This can help in understanding the most common features.
- Price Distribution based on Number of Previous Owners: This can provide insights into how the number of previous owners might affect property value.
