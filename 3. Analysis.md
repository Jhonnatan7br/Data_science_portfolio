# Data analysis
A real estate brand would be interested in insights that can help them understand the market better, make informed decisions, and potentially optimize their pricing strategies. Here are some analyses and visualizations we can perform:

- Distribution of House Prices: This will provide an overview of the range and distribution of house prices in the dataset.
- Distribution of House Categories ('Basic' vs 'Luxury'): Understanding the proportion of houses in each category can give insights into market segmentation.
- Price Distribution by Category: Comparing the price distributions of 'Basic' and 'Luxury' houses.
- Price vs. Square Meters: Understand how the size of a property affects its price.
- Number of Houses with Specific Features: Such as having a pool, yard, or storm protector. This can help in understanding the most common features.
- Price Distribution based on Number of Previous Owners: This can provide insights into how the number of previous owners might affect property value.

# Distribution of House Prices

The histogram displays the distribution of house prices in the dataset. From the graph, we can observe that most of the house prices cluster in a certain range, with a few houses at the higher price range, indicating some luxury or outlier properties.

# Distribution of House Categories

How many houses fall into the 'Basic' category versus the 'Luxury' category. This will give us an idea of market segmentation.

The bar chart displays the distribution of houses by category. It appears that there's a relatively even distribution between 'Basic' and 'Luxury' houses in this dataset.

# Price distributions of 'Basic' and 'Luxury' houses. 

This will give us an idea of the price range for each category and help identify any significant differences in price distributions between the two categories.

The boxplot compares the price distributions of 'Basic' and 'Luxury' houses. From the graph:

The median price of 'Luxury' houses is higher than that of 'Basic' houses, as expected.
The interquartile range (the height of the boxes) for 'Luxury' houses is broader than for 'Basic' houses, indicating a wider range of prices within the luxury category.
There are some outliers in both categories, especially in the 'Basic' category, which might represent houses with special features or in prime locations.

#  How the size of a property (in square meters) affects its price. 

We'll create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between square meters and price.

The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the size of a property (in square meters) and its price. From the graph:

There's a positive correlation between the size of a property and its price, which is expected.
However, there's a significant spread, indicating that while size plays a role in determining the price, other factors also significantly influence property prices.

# Number of houses with specific features, such as having a pool, yard, or storm protector. 
This can give insights into the most desirable or common features in the dataset.

The bar chart displays the number of houses with specific features:

A significant number of houses have storm protectors, suggesting that it might be a standard or highly desirable feature.

Houses with yards are relatively common, whereas houses with pools are less frequent.
A decent number of houses also have storage rooms.
Understanding these feature distributions can be valuable for a real estate brand to know which features are standard and which can be marketed as premium.

# how the number of previous owners might affect property value. 

We'll visualize the distribution of prices based on the number of previous owners.

The boxplot displays the distribution of prices based on the number of previous owners:

The median price seems relatively consistent across different numbers of previous owners, with some fluctuations.
There's a notable increase in the interquartile range (the height of the boxes) for houses with more than 8 previous owners, suggesting a wider range of prices in this category.
There are some outliers, especially for houses with 4 or 5 previous owners, which might represent properties with unique features or in prime locations.

# Conclusions

From these insights, a real estate brand can infer that while the number of previous owners has some influence on property prices, it's not the dominant factor. Other features and characteristics of the property play a more substantial role in determining its value.

In conclusion, these analyses provide valuable insights into the Paris housing market, at least based on this dataset. A real estate brand can use this information to develop marketing strategies, adjust pricing, or target specific segments of the market more effectively.
